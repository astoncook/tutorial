# Stacks

Stacks are a very important way for us to store items in First-In/Last-Out or Last-In/First-out. We can add a new varrible in one end and remove the varrible from the same end.

We can use this data structure in the real world for things like:

* Undo button on websites
* Back and foward opperations on browsers
* Language processing on programs

In simple terms we have two main functions associated with stack. Those are "Push" and "Pop". There are many more, but for today we will talk about the main two.
