# Python Databases Tutorial

Welcome to my Python Databases Tutorial. Advancing in Python can be a fun thing, but having the basics of efficency and data structures will help a programmer tremendously. These are the topics I am going to cover:

* [Stacks](https://github.com/astoncook/tutorial/blob/master/1-topic.mdd)
* [Set](https://github.com/astoncook/tutorial/blob/master/2-topic.md)
* [Trees](https://github.com/astoncook/tutorial/blob/master/3-topic.md)

Each of my modules will contain an introduction and examples of coding problems that include these topics. Each module will contain a practice problem and a solution at the end of the tutorial for each problem.
